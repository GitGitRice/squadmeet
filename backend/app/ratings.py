"""Ratings (SCRUM-31): 1–5 stars and at least one Reason for a Place (see CONTEXT.md).

One Rating per user per Place; a second one replaces the first. No location check.
The Place detail shows the average stars, the most chosen Reasons and the Condition.

The Condition comes only from the Reasons that the city or the operator must fix
(`condition_issue` in app/reasons.py). Such an issue stays until users say it is fixed
(Stefan's decision, 2026-10-09):

- For RECENT_DAYS after the last Rating that names it, the issue simply counts.
- Then a check opens: the Place detail shows the issue as "not confirmed" and asks logged-in
  users "Ist das noch so?". Each user has one vote per check; a later vote replaces their own.
- VOTES_NEEDED votes "still there" confirm it for another RECENT_DAYS, from the last of them.
- VOTES_NEEDED votes "fixed" end it, until a new or changed Rating names it again.

Nothing is stored about checks except the votes: the state is worked out from the Ratings and
the votes each time (`issue_state`), so two votes at the same moment cannot break it.
